<h1>My Profile<h1>  


<h2> Background <h2>
Born and raised in Saudi Arabia though, my original nationality is Lebanese. I was fortunate enough to get my education at an international school where all my colleagues and friends were from different countries and had different cultures making it a rich environment to grow up in. My main language is English though I grew up in an Arabic country, my Arabic is secondary. I am a media fanatic and have worked on ads and freelanced in almost all areas of media.
  
<h2> Interest in I.T.<h2>
Playing videogames as a child made me wonder how all of it was possible. It is only in recent days after having struggled in and out of jobs that I learned the importance of learning I.T. because it will open a wider range of opportunities especially in this day and age. My best friend quit his job to pursue greater work on his own terms specializing in development of apps and more. Studying abroad especially online is a new experience entirely however, the main reason was because I felt local educational programs are too costly and unsatisfactory. Learning how a computer works, and how to utilize a computer’s power to create, and develop programs, apps, websites, and more is the knowledge I seek to gain from my studies.
  
 
 <h2>Ideal Job<h2>
The job I would be seeking would mostly have to do with development and programming though I am leaning towards web/app design and development.

The positions would require years of experience and practice, my skills at the moment cover only the basic fundamentals of building and developing an app/web page. I would need to get more experience and really work hard to gain the necessary skills to go forward with job seeking. I am looking forward to interning somewhere that can help me grow and learn the skills I need in order to continue. The program languages I would be working with would mostly be Java, HTML5, CSS, C++.

<h2>Tests and Potential<h2>
The tests that were undertaken were interesting to take not only to present to people but, for self-assessment. The tests help you understand what type of person you are dealing with and whether that person or specific individual would be a qualified to be a part of the team. It is important to know a person before going into a team based project especially if it is long term. The test do help you discern what type of individual is joining however, tests don’t always show the truth and so, you must always trust team work to be the ultimate test for everyone involved.
